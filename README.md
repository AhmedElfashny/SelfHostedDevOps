# SelfHostedDevOps
elf-hosted DevOps environment where I implement and experiment with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, infrastructure automation, and security tools. It includes Jenkins, Prometheus, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Terraform, and more running on VMs. This repo documents my setup, configurations, and best practices for a complete DevOps stack.
