ðŸ“Œ MyDevOpsLab
ðŸš€ A self-hosted DevOps environment with essential tools like Jenkins, Prometheus, Git, and more.

This repository documents my journey in setting up and managing a local DevOps stack on virtual machines (VMs). It includes:
âœ… CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD)
âœ… Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack)
âœ… Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (Terraform, Ansible)
âœ… Containerization & Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
âœ… Source Code Management (Git, GitHub Actions)
âœ… Security & Access Control (Keycloak, Vault)

ðŸ’¡ Why This Repo?
This is my hands-on DevOps lab, where I implement and experiment with tools, automate workflows, and document my learnings. Whether it's deploying on VMs, setting up self-hosted services, or testing cloud-native solutions, this repo serves as my personal DevOps playground.

ðŸ”§ Planned Features: (To be updated as I progress)

Automating VM provisioning
Setting up a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster
Deploying monitoring & alerting systems
Implementing GitOps workflows
